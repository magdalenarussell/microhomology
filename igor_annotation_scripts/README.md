# IGoR annotation scripts

This directory contains scripts necessary to annotate sequences using IGoR and simulate IGoR sequences.

The main scripts are contained in the following files:

* [Annotation script](annotate_with_igor.sh): annotates sequences contained in indicated files using default pre-trained IGoR model
* [Simulation script](simulate_seqs_with_igor.sh): simulates synthetic sequences using default pre-trained IGoR model

Scripts and functions to support these top-level scripts can be found in the [annotate directory](annotate) and the [simulate directory](simulate)
