# Microhomology simulation scripts

This directory contains files for running the microhomology simulator to generate simulated datasets for model testing.

The main scripts are contained in the following files:

* [Run trimming and ligation simulator](run_ligation-mh_trim-mh_signal_simulator.sh): Simulate trimming and ligation configuration generation with varying MH involvement in the choices being made
* [Run trimming simulator](run_intermediate-mh_signal_simulator.sh): Simulate trimming configuration generation with varying MH involvement in the choices being made (no ligation simulated)

The specific functions and scripts for each simulator are located within the [trimming simulator directory](intermediate-mh_signal_simulator_scripts) and the [trimming/ligation simulator directory](ligation-mh_signal_simulator)
